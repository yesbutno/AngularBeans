- Binds `$scope` to bean models.
- Handles HTTP methods calls.  
- Detailed control over server side and client side data updates.
- Handle real-time calls via WebSockets or SockJS integration.
- queryModels: queries from server to client and updates the models.
- Events and queryModels broadcast.
- Angular form validation based on Bean Validation annotations.
- Built in i18n Translation.
- Event Driven, Real Time, and lightweight.
